### iCal Feed
Subscribe to project deadlines from any calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.).

**Setup**
- Navigate to **Calendar** in the admin panel.
- Copy the iCal feed URL shown at the bottom of the page.
- Add it to your calendar app as a URL/subscription calendar.
- Feed URL format: `https://yourdomain.com/api/calendar/feed?token=<token>`.

**Token management**
- Each admin gets a unique feed URL with a secure 64-character token.
- Click **Regenerate** to create a new token — the old URL stops working immediately.
- Tokens are stored per admin user; deleting a user invalidates their feed.

**Feed behavior**
- The feed includes **all projects with a due date**, regardless of status or age.
- Events are never removed from the feed — past deadlines persist as historical records.
- All events use iCal `STATUS:CONFIRMED` so calendar apps always display them.
- Approved projects are prefixed with a checkmark in the title (e.g. "✓ Summer Campaign").
- Archived projects are prefixed with a cross (e.g. "✗ Old Project").
- Active/in-review projects show the plain title.
- Events are all-day events (date-only, no time component) — they appear in the top banner of calendar apps, not as time-blocked slots.
- Each event includes a direct URL link back to the project in the admin panel.
- The `UID` for each event is the project ID, so calendar apps correctly update existing events on refresh.

**Sync & caching**
- The feed response includes `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers, but calendar apps control their own refresh interval (typically 15 minutes to 24 hours).
- To force a refresh: remove and re-add the subscription in your calendar app.
- Rate limited to 10 requests per minute per IP.

**Technical details (RFC 5545)**
- Format: iCalendar (`.ics`) with `METHOD:PUBLISH`.
- Events are `VEVENT` with `VALUE=DATE` (all-day).
- `STATUS:CONFIRMED` for all events (not `COMPLETED`, which causes calendar apps to hide events).
- Calendar name: "ViTransfer Deadlines" (`X-WR-CALNAME`).

## Per-project settings
**Video processing**
- Preview resolution override.
- Skip transcoding override.
- Max upload size override.

**Client access**
- Auth mode: PASSWORD (default), OTP, BOTH, NONE, or GUEST.
- Password (AES-256 encrypted).
- Custom URL slug.
- Guest mode: view-only access without credentials.
- Guest latest only: restrict guests to the latest version of each video (default: true).
- Show photo albums to guests: guests can view photo albums; downloads stay disabled for guests (default: false).

**Workflow**
- Revision limit (enable/disable with max revisions count).
- Allow comments.
- Comment attachments toggle.
- Max comment attachments override.
- Allow downloads.
- Allow photo downloads: clients can download photos (selection, album, or all project photos as a ZIP).
- Allow client asset uploads.
- Allow client file submissions (reverse share): clients can upload files directly to the project from the share page without attaching them to a comment. Uploaded files are visible in a "Client Uploads" block on the admin project page.
- Client can approve (disable for admin-only approval).
- Hide feedback from other clients.
- Restrict comments to latest version only.
- Timestamp display format.
- Show client tutorial overlay.
- Use preview for approved playback.

**Due dates**
- Due date: optional date picker for project deadline.
- Due reminder: NONE, DAY_BEFORE, or WEEK_BEFORE.
- Due dates are stored at noon UTC to prevent timezone day-boundary issues.
- Displayed in the user's local timezone (browser timezone client-side, `TZ` env var server-side).

**Notifications**
- Client notification schedule override (DAILY/WEEKLY with configurable time and day).
- Recipients list with per-recipient language preference.
