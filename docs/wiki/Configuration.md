## S3-Compatible Storage

Set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` to have uploads and downloads bypass Node.js and go directly between the browser and your object store. No rebuild needed — the setting is read at runtime.

**Tested with:** MinIO AIStor (self-hosted Docker container). Other S3-compatible stores (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Garage, etc.) should work but have not been tested — please [open an issue](https://github.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer/issues) if you run into any problems.

**How it works:**
- **Uploads** — the browser requests presigned part URLs from ViTransfer, then PUTs each chunk straight to the store. Node.js never touches the file bytes. This applies to all uploads: videos, comment attachments, and client file submissions (reverse share).
- **Individual downloads** — the server generates a short-lived presigned GET URL and issues a 302 redirect. Node.js proxies nothing. This covers single video downloads, asset downloads, and client upload downloads.
- **ZIP downloads** — "Download All Videos" and single-video-with-assets ZIPs stream file data from S3 through the server, since the archive must be assembled before delivery. The ZIP is streamed to the browser as it is built (not buffered in memory).
- **Worker** — FFmpeg jobs stream directly from/to object storage via the SDK; no shared volume is needed.

**Important:** Local and S3 storage cannot be mixed. Switching from one to the other does not move or delete any files — they remain where they are — but ViTransfer will only read from the active backend. Projects stored in the previous backend will not work until their files are manually migrated to the new storage. There is no built-in migration tool. This is by design.

**Important:** The S3 variables are set in your `.env` file and are automatically passed to both the app and worker services via `docker-compose.yml`. Do not add them to individual services manually — both containers need the same S3 configuration.

**Requirements:**
1. Create the bucket before starting ViTransfer.
2. Configure CORS on the bucket to allow `GET` and `PUT` requests from your app origin (required for presigned uploads and downloads from the browser).
3. Set `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` and the `S3_*` variables in your `.env`.

**Example `.env`:**
```
STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com        # or your store's endpoint
S3_BUCKET=vitransfer
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Provider notes

**MinIO AIStor** — uses path-style addressing, which ViTransfer enables automatically when `S3_ENDPOINT` is set. Set `S3_ENDPOINT` to your MinIO hostname (e.g. `http://minio:9000`).

**AWS S3** — set `S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com` and the correct `S3_REGION`.

**Cloudflare R2** — endpoint is `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. Set `S3_REGION=auto`.

**Backblaze B2** — endpoint is `https://s3.<region>.backblazeb2.com`. Use your B2 application key ID and key.

### CORS configuration

The browser needs direct access to your object store for two operations:
- **`PUT`** — uploading file parts via presigned URLs
- **`GET`** — video playback and file downloads via presigned URLs

The `ETag` response header must also be exposed (browsers block it by default), or uploads will fail with "Part returned no ETag".

All other S3 operations (multipart initiation, completion, abort) happen server-side and do not require CORS.

**MinIO AIStor** — CORS is typically permissive by default, but if you've locked it down:
```bash
mc alias set myminio http://minio:9000 <access-key> <secret-key>
mc admin config set myminio/ api cors_allow_origin=https://vitransfer.example.com
mc admin service restart myminio/
```

**AWS S3 / R2 / B2** — configure the bucket CORS policy via the provider's console or CLI.

Example JSON CORS policy:
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://vitransfer.example.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

## CPU Threads & Video Processing

### Overview

The worker computes its CPU allocation from a budget of **half the available threads**, so the worst case (all video workers encoding at once) never exceeds ~50% of the host and the server stays responsive during processing. `CPU_THREADS` overrides the auto-detected thread count that the budget is based on.

1. **Worker concurrency** — 2 concurrent video jobs on hosts with 24+ threads, otherwise 1
2. **Threads per job** — the budget split across the video workers (the `-threads` flag), capped at 8
3. **Encoding preset** — always `faster`, the speed/size sweet spot for CRF-based review previews

### Example allocations

| Threads | Concurrent jobs | FFmpeg threads/job | Max threads used |
|:-------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| 2       | 1               | 1                  | 1 (~50%)         |
| 4       | 1               | 2                  | 2 (~50%)         |
| 8       | 1               | 4                  | 4 (~50%)         |
| 16      | 1               | 8                  | 8 (~50%)         |
| 24      | 2               | 6                  | 12 (~50%)        |
| 32      | 2               | 8                  | 16 (~50%)        |
| 64      | 2               | 8                  | 16 (~25%)        |

"Max threads used" is the video processing workers multiplied by the FFmpeg threads per job. The resolved allocation is printed at worker startup (`[CPU CONFIG]` log lines).

### Manual overrides

For hosts where the 50% budget is not what you want (dedicated transcode machines, high-core servers), three variables bypass the computed values:

- `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` — concurrent video jobs (1-16)
- `FFMPEG_THREADS_PER_JOB` — FFmpeg threads per transcode (1-64)
- `FFMPEG_PRESET` — any x264 preset from `ultrafast` to `veryslow` (e.g. `medium` for smaller files at slower encode speed)

Overrides are taken as-is: setting them high deliberately opts out of the 50% headroom guarantee.

### When to set this

- **Docker**: Containers may report the host CPU count rather than the cgroup limit. Set `CPU_THREADS` to match your `--cpus` or `deploy.resources.limits.cpus` value for accurate allocation.
- **Shared servers**: Lower `CPU_THREADS` to leave headroom for other services.
- **Dedicated servers**: Leave unset — auto-detection works correctly.

### Example

An 8-thread server with `CPU_THREADS` unset (auto-detected as 8):

```
Detected threads: 8
 → 1 concurrent video job
 → 2 FFmpeg threads per job
 → Preset: faster
 → Max 4/8 threads in use (~50%)
 → Remaining threads available for the web app, database, and uploads
```

## Transfer tuning

Three optional environment variables control upload/download throughput and memory use. The defaults are tuned for a modern dedicated server and don't need adjustment in most setups. Tweak only if you're chasing throughput on a fast LAN, or trimming memory on a small VPS.

### `TRANSFER_STREAM_HWM_MB` (default `16`)

Per-transfer read buffer used when streaming files from local storage (downloads and the video player). Memory consumed per active transfer is roughly this value × the number of concurrent transfers.

- **Default `16`** is fine for any server with ≥ 4 GB RAM.
- **Raise to `32` or `64`** on a beefy server (e.g. ≥ 16 GB RAM, fast disk) for slightly higher per-transfer throughput.
- **Lower to `4` or `8`** if you're memory-constrained and/or expect many concurrent downloads.
- Range: 1–64 MiB.

### `TRANSFER_STREAM_CHUNK_MB` (default `4`)

Cap on a single video-player Range request. The HTML5 player issues many small Range requests as the user seeks; this cap keeps the UI responsive on seek and prevents a single tab from hogging server I/O. Does **not** apply to direct downloads — those serve the full file.

- **Default `4`** matches typical browser HTML5-video range behavior.
- **Raise to `8` or `16`** if your players are doing long sequential reads (e.g. preview-only streaming with no seeking).
- Range: 1–64 MiB.

### `S3_SERVER_MULTIPART_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`)

Number of concurrent multipart parts the worker uploads in parallel when shipping transcoded outputs back to your S3 store. Only relevant in S3 mode.

- **Default `4`** is conservative and works well on most networks.
- **Raise to `8` or `12`** on a fast LAN to MinIO/Ceph for noticeably faster post-transcode uploads.
- **Lower to `2`** if your S3 endpoint is rate-limited or shared with many tenants.
- Range: 1–16.

### Recommended profiles

| Server profile | `TRANSFER_STREAM_HWM_MB` | `S3_SERVER_MULTIPART_CONCURRENCY` |
|---|---|---|
| Small VPS (2 GB RAM) | `4` | `2` |
| Default (4–16 GB RAM) | `16` (default) | `4` (default) |
| Dedicated server (≥ 32 GB RAM, fast LAN) | `32` | `8`–`12` |
| Cloud (S3 over the public internet) | `16` (default) | `4`–`8` |
