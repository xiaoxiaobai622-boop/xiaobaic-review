# Usage Guide

## Creating your first project
1. Login to the admin panel.
2. Create a project with title, description, client name/email, and password (recommended).
3. Upload videos — use the Upload Video(s) card, or drag video files or entire folders straight onto the Videos section.
4. Share the client link.
5. Collect timestamped feedback.
6. Approve when the client accepts the final version.

On the project page, click a video thumbnail to play its transcoded preview in place (the original file is never streamed). Expanding a video shows the rename and delete buttons next to its name — delete removes the video with all of its versions, while individual versions can be deleted inside the expanded list.

## Client workflow
1. Open the share link.
2. Enter password/OTP if required.
3. Watch videos and leave timestamped feedback.
4. Approve when satisfied.
5. Download approved videos if enabled.

## Drawing annotations on video
1. Pause the video at the desired frame.
2. Click the annotation tool in the player toolbar.
3. Draw freehand on the video frame using the selected color and opacity.
4. Use undo/redo to adjust your drawing.
5. Submit the annotation — it is attached to the comment at the current timecode.

## Attaching files to comments
1. Click the attachment icon in the comment input area.
2. Select one or more files to upload (uses TUS resumable uploads).
3. Files upload in the background with progress tracking.
4. Submit the comment — attachments are linked to the comment.

## Installing as a PWA
1. Open ViTransfer in a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
2. Click the install prompt in the address bar or browser menu.
3. The app installs to your device home screen or dock.
4. Works offline-capable with full UI access.

## Enabling browser push notifications
1. Go to Settings > Browser Push Notifications (admin) or enable via the bell icon (client).
2. Allow the browser notification permission when prompted.
3. Select which events you want to receive push notifications for.
4. Use "Send Test" to verify your device receives notifications.

## Setting due dates on projects
1. When creating or editing a project, use the **Due Date** picker to set a deadline.
2. Optionally set a **Due Reminder** (Day Before or Week Before) to receive automated notifications.
3. Due dates appear on the project card, project detail page, and in the calendar view.
4. Color-coded urgency: red (overdue), orange (today/tomorrow), blue (within 7 days).

## Using the calendar view
1. Navigate to **Calendar** in the admin sidebar.
2. Switch between **Calendar** and **Gantt** tabs.
3. Calendar supports day, week, month (default), and year views via the scale toggle.
4. Click a date to see projects due that day; click a project to navigate to it.
5. The Gantt chart shows a timeline of all projects with due dates, color-coded by status.

## Subscribing to the iCal feed
1. Go to **Calendar** in the admin panel.
2. Copy the iCal feed URL shown at the bottom of the page.
3. Add it to your calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.) as a URL subscription.
4. All projects with due dates appear as all-day events in your calendar.
5. Changes sync automatically when your calendar app refreshes the feed (typically every 15 min to 24 hours depending on the app).
6. To force a refresh, remove and re-add the subscription in your calendar app.
7. To invalidate the feed URL, click **Regenerate** — this creates a new token and the old URL stops working.

**What appears in the feed:**
- All projects with a due date are included, regardless of status or whether the date is in the past.
- Approved projects show with a ✓ prefix (e.g. "✓ Summer Campaign").
- Archived projects show with a ✗ prefix (e.g. "✗ Old Project").
- Events are never removed — deadlines are preserved as historical records.
- Each event links back to the project in the admin panel.

## Comparing video versions
1. Open a project with 2 or more versions of the same video.
2. Click the **Compare** button in the version selector bar.
3. A fullscreen comparison view opens with two version selectors (A and B).
4. By default, A is the previous version and B is the latest version.
5. Use **Side-by-Side** mode to view both versions next to each other with synced playback.
6. Switch to **Slider** mode for an overlay comparison — drag the vertical divider to reveal each side.
7. Controls are shared: play/pause, seek, frame step, and speed affect both videos simultaneously.
8. On mobile, side-by-side mode stacks vertically (top/bottom). Slider mode works as-is.
9. Press **Escape** or the X button to close the comparison view.

## Configuring privacy disclosure
1. Go to **Settings** in the admin panel.
2. Enable **Privacy Disclosure** under the Privacy section.
3. Optionally enter custom disclosure text (leave blank to use the default i18n text).
4. Clients will see a privacy banner on share pages and can accept or decline analytics tracking.

## Setting up activity summary emails
1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**.
2. Set **Admin Notification Schedule** to DAILY or WEEKLY for periodic admin digests.
3. Configure the time and day for scheduled deliveries.
4. Per-project client notification schedules can be set under project settings (DAILY/WEEKLY with specific time and day).
5. Customize the email content via **Settings > Email Templates** (CLIENT_ACTIVITY_SUMMARY and ADMIN_ACTIVITY_SUMMARY templates).

## Using reverse share (client file submissions)

Reverse share lets clients upload files directly to a project from the share page — useful for collecting raw footage, audio, project files, or any deliverable without requiring a comment.

**Enabling it:**
1. Open the project, go to **Settings**.
2. Under **Client Share Page**, enable **Allow Client File Submissions**.
3. Save. A "Submit Files" button now appears in the top-left corner of the client share page.

**Viewing submitted files (admin):**
1. Open the project page in the admin panel.
2. A **Client Uploads** block appears below the videos section.
3. Each entry shows the file name, size, uploader name/email (if authenticated), and upload date.
4. Click the download icon to download a single file, or the trash icon to delete it.

## Photo albums

Projects can hold photo albums alongside videos — useful for stills, BTS shots, or photo deliverables.

**Creating and filling albums (admin):**
1. Open the project page; the **Photo Albums** section sits below the videos.
2. Create an album and drag photos onto it, or drop entire folders onto the section — each folder becomes its own album.
3. Click an album to fold it open in place: photos are listed with pagination, and the rename/delete buttons appear next to the album name.
4. The worker generates webp thumbnails automatically; uploads work on both local (TUS) and S3 storage.
5. Use the star on a photo row to set it as the album cover; a sort toggle in the section header switches between name and date order.

**Client side:** albums appear on the share page below the videos, with a full-page album view, lightbox, and multi-select. To let clients download photos (selection, album, or all project photos as a ZIP), enable **Allow photo downloads** in the project settings.

## Recipient portal

Recipients added to projects can use the portal at `/portal` to see all their active projects in one place:

1. The recipient enters their email at `/portal` and receives a magic link — no password needed.
2. After signing in they see every active project they are assigned to, and can open each share page directly.
3. Available in English, Dutch, and German.

## Dashboard filters and saved views

The projects dashboard supports search, multi-select filters (status, client, year, due date), and sorting:

- Active filters show as removable chips above the list.
- Save a filter combination as a named view for one-click reuse (views are per admin user).
- Filter state is reflected in the URL, so a filtered dashboard link can be shared with other admins.

## Bulk selecting assets and client uploads

Both the **video asset list** (per video) and the **Client Uploads** block support multi-select for bulk download or delete.

1. Click the checkbox on the left of any row to start selecting.
2. A bulk action bar appears at the top of the list showing the count of selected items.
3. Click the count to toggle **Select All / Deselect All**.
4. Click **Download** to download all selected files sequentially.
5. Click **Delete** to delete all selected files after a single confirmation prompt.
6. Individual per-row actions still work as before.

## Admin tips
- Enable reverse share to collect raw files or deliverables from clients without needing a comment.
- Use bulk select on video assets and client uploads to download or delete multiple files at once.
- Use custom URLs for memorable share links.
- Enable revision tracking for complex projects.
- Monitor analytics to track engagement.
- Use Security Logs to track access attempts.
- Set due dates and use the calendar view to manage project deadlines.
- Enable privacy disclosure for GDPR compliance.
- Use skip-transcoding mode for projects that don't need transcoded previews.
- Set admin session inactivity timeout for enhanced security.
